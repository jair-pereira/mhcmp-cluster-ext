# Cluster-based Analysis of Empirical Metaheuristics Performance
This repository contains the code, data, and figures for our paper submission.

<!-- In this study, we propose a clustering-based method to characterize the performance of metaheuristic algorithms based on their performance on benchmark problems with diverse landscape characteristics. -->

<!-- ## Running the analysis
[1_process_bbob_data.py](https://github.com/jair-pereira/mhsim_cmaes/blob/main/1_process_bbob_data.py) downloads and processes the necessary data from the COCO Data Archive
[2_make_figures.py](https://github.com/jair-pereira/mhsim_cmaes/blob/main/2_make_figures.py) generates the following figures in the paper
1. Performance Similarity Heatmap
2. Component Similarity Heatmap
3. Pearson Correlation Index

Those figures are in the folder [data/](https://github.com/jair-pereira/mhsim_cmaes/tree/main/data) -->
